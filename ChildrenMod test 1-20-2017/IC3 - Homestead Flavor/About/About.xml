  <description>Combines my favorite homestead-y bits from various mods:
  

  * [sd] round tables - just the small table
  * Fireplaces by BaconBits
  * Animal Trough by BaconBits, tweaked to hold corn, too
  * Barn Stall by BaconBits
  * Wall Torch by BaconBits, just the fueled one
  
  By me:
  * Coffee table
